# Shutdown Command - Implementation Plan

## Goal
Implement a first CoS command, `/shutdown`, that captures a freeform brain dump and sorts it into:
- TODOs / action items
- Knowledgebase items
- Calendar items

## Recommended MVP
Start with a review-only workflow that is specified independently from any one host, then use it inside Codex chat first before building external integrations.

Why:
- It lets us validate the capture and classification rules first.
- It avoids premature coupling to Notion, Google Calendar, or a knowledgebase.
- It keeps the first version simple enough to test daily.
- It preserves portability across Codex on Windows/Mac and Goose on Mac.

## MVP User Flow
1. You type `/shutdown`.
2. The CoS replies with a fixed capture prompt.
3. You paste one large brain dump.
4. The CoS parses the dump into candidate items.
5. The CoS returns four sections:
   - TODOs / action items
   - Knowledgebase items
   - Calendar items
   - Ambiguous / needs review
6. You review and optionally ask for edits or export.

## Implementation Shape

### Option A: Prompt-only workflow in Codex chat
Use a saved prompt or slash-command wrapper that injects a structured instruction set.

Pros:
- Fastest to ship
- No app code required
- Easy to iterate on classification behavior

Cons:
- No persistence by default
- No true command routing unless the host app supports slash commands

### Option B: Small local command wrapper
Build a lightweight script that:
1. Detects `/shutdown`
2. Shows the capture prompt
3. Accepts pasted input
4. Sends both to the model with a structured classification prompt
5. Prints a formatted result

Pros:
- Repeatable workflow
- Easier to add storage and integrations later

Cons:
- Requires choosing a runtime and command host

## Recommendation
Implement Option A first in Codex, but define the workflow in host-agnostic terms so it can later be reproduced in Goose or a wrapper script once the classification rules are stable.

## Portability Constraint

Design `/shutdown` as three layers:
1. Workflow contract
   - The user invokes shutdown
   - The system asks for a brain dump
   - The system classifies items into fixed buckets
   - The system returns a structured review
2. Prompt contract
   - The exact capture prompt
   - The exact classification rules
   - The exact output structure
3. Host adapter
   - Codex skill
   - Goose prompt/agent
   - Future local wrapper or automation

Only the host adapter should be tool-specific. The workflow contract and prompt contract should remain shared across environments.

## Core Prompt Contract

### Trigger
The user types `/shutdown`.

### Assistant response
Return this style of prompt:

"Paste everything still in your head or sitting in temporary places. Include rough notes, reminders, ideas, commitments, dates, and anything unfinished. I will sort it into TODOs, knowledgebase items, calendar items, and anything ambiguous."

### Classification rules
- A TODO / action item is something that requires you to do, decide, follow up on, or deliver something.
- A knowledgebase item is information worth preserving for later reference, but not something that requires immediate action.
- A calendar item is time-bound and belongs on a schedule, reminder, or event list.
- If an item fits more than one bucket, prefer:
  1. Calendar item if timing is the primary need
  2. TODO if execution is the primary need
  3. Knowledgebase item if reference is the primary need
- If the item is too unclear to classify safely, place it in Ambiguous / needs review.

### Output format
The result should always include:
1. TODOs / action items
2. Knowledgebase items
3. Calendar items
4. Ambiguous / needs review

For each item, preserve enough detail to reconstruct the original intent.

## Suggested MVP Output Template

### TODOs / Action Items
- [title] - [supporting detail]

### Knowledgebase Items
- [topic] - [supporting detail]

### Calendar Items
- [item] - [date/time if present] - [supporting detail]

### Ambiguous / Needs Review
- [item] - [why it is ambiguous]

## Minimal Files To Build

### 1. Prompt spec
Store the shutdown prompt contract in this repo so the behavior stays consistent.

### 2. Example inputs/outputs
Create a small test fixture file with realistic end-of-day brain dumps and expected classifications.

### 3. Optional wrapper script
Later, add a script for repeatable execution.

## Suggested File Layout
- `shutdown-command-spec-starter.md`
- `shutdown-command-questionnaire-checklist.md`
- `shutdown-command-implementation-plan.md`
- `examples/shutdown-sample-input.md`
- `examples/shutdown-sample-output.md`

## Phase Plan

### Phase 1 - Manual MVP
- Finalize classification rules
- Use `/shutdown` as a repeatable prompt pattern
- Review results manually
- Refine based on a week of real usage

### Phase 2 - Structured output
- Add stricter formatting
- Add extraction of due dates, names, projects, and notes
- Add an explicit ambiguous bucket

### Phase 3 - Persistence
- Save raw dump plus classified output locally
- Add a simple history log for later review

### Phase 4 - Integrations
- TODOs -> task system
- Knowledgebase items -> notes store
- Calendar items -> calendar queue or direct event creation

## What We Need To Decide Before Coding
- Where `/shutdown` actually lives first
- Whether v1 should save raw dumps locally
- Whether one item can appear in multiple buckets
- Whether the CoS should ask clarifying questions before producing output

## Recommended Defaults
- Run `/shutdown` first in Codex chat
- Accept one freeform paste
- Return grouped review output only
- Preserve ambiguous items instead of guessing
- No external writes in v1
- Keep the classification contract portable so the same behavior can be reused in Goose later

## First Coding Step
The best first build step is not an integration. It is creating example shutdown inputs and expected outputs so we can test classification quality before wiring this into any tool.
