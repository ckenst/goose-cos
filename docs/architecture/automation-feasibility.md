# Codex Automation Feasibility for chiefOS

After reviewing the local project README and the linked GitHub guide, here is what can be handled directly by Codex automations/skills versus what still needs extra integration work.

## Sources Reviewed
- Local: `/Users/ckenst/Development/chiefOS/README.md`
- Linked GitHub guide: `https://github.com/jimprosser/claude-code-cos`
- Raw guide README: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimprosser/claude-code-cos/main/README.md`

## Directly Doable with Codex Now
- Spec and workflow authoring in this repo (templates/checklists already present).
- Scheduled Codex automations to run recurring prompts (summaries, triage reports, review workflows).
- Parallel subagent orchestration for Morning Sweep-style processing.
- Local state tracking and report generation in files.

## Not Directly Doable Without Extra Setup
- Gmail read/search, Todoist/Notion task create/update, Google Calendar writes, and Google Maps transit calls.
- External one-button trigger wiring (Stream Deck, Raycast, Keyboard Maestro).
- A strict headless allowlist model equivalent to Claude Code `--allowedTools`, unless implemented with custom scripts/connectors.

## Skills Status in This Environment
- Installed skills:
  - `openai-docs`
  - `skill-creator`
  - `skill-installer`
- None of these are ready-made Gmail/Calendar/Todoist/Notion operator skills.
- Result: Layer 2 Inbox Scan still needs custom connector/script implementation for full end-to-end execution.

## Suggested Next Framing
Split implementation into two tracks:
1. Works today with no external APIs.
2. Add connectors/scripts for full Layer 2 parity.
