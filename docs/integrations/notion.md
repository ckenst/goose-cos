# Notion Integration

ChiefOS can create and search items in a target Notion database called `Backlog`.

This is the first Notion destination. The integration is intentionally shaped so more targeted destinations can be added later, such as content ideas, calendar review queues, or project-specific databases.

## Setup

1. Create a Notion internal integration and copy its secret.
2. Share the `Backlog` database with that integration.
3. Copy the Backlog database ID from the Notion URL.
4. Create a local `.env` file:

```sh
NOTION_API=secret_from_notion
NOTION_BACKLOG_DATABASE_ID=database_id_from_notion
```

## Recommended Backlog Properties

The script only requires a title property.

Optional properties are used if they exist:
- `Type` as a select
- `Status` as a select
- `Source` as rich text

The title property can have any name, such as `Name` or `Task`.

## Create A Backlog Item

```sh
npm run notion:backlog -- --title "Move shutdown brainstorm into Notion" --type "TODO" --content "Captured from ChiefOS shutdown."
```

## Search Backlog

Use this when the chat needs to answer from Notion data:

```sh
npm run notion:backlog:search -- --query "Playwright"
```

The command returns matching page titles, common property values, page URLs, and plain text from top-level page blocks.

## Weekly Plan

Use Weekly Plan commands when the user asks what they are working on, what they are supposed to work on this week, or asks to move items between weekly columns.

What am I working on?

```sh
npm run notion:weekly-plan:working
```

What am I supposed to work on this week?

```sh
npm run notion:weekly-plan:summary
```

What is still to do?

```sh
npm run notion:weekly-plan:todo
```

Add an item:

```sh
npm run notion:weekly-plan -- --action add --title "Return iPhone Mini to T-Mobile" --status Doing --due-date 2026-04-30
```

Move an item:

```sh
npm run notion:weekly-plan -- --action move --title "Build out Chief of Staff" --to-status Doing
```

Set a due date:

```sh
npm run notion:weekly-plan -- --action set-due-date --title "TCorg newsletter" --due-date 2026-04-30
```

## Dry Run

Use dry run to inspect the Notion API payload without creating anything:

```sh
npm run notion:backlog:dry-run
```

Or:

```sh
npm run notion:backlog -- --dry-run --title "Example backlog item" --content "Created by ChiefOS."
```

Search dry run:

```sh
npm run notion:backlog:search:dry-run
```

## Chat Contract

The intended workflow is chat-first:
- When the user asks ChiefOS to create something in Notion, the chat should use the Backlog command unless a more specific destination is configured.
- When the user asks what they are working on, use the Weekly Plan `Doing` view.
- When the user asks what they are supposed to work on this week, use the Weekly Plan summary view.
- When the user asks a question that should be answered from Notion, the chat should search the relevant Notion destination before answering.
- If Notion credentials or database IDs are missing, the chat should say what is missing rather than pretending it checked Notion.
- If multiple Notion destinations exist later, the chat should choose the most specific destination first and fall back to Backlog for general capture.

## Destination Model

Current destination:
- `Backlog`: general capture database for early ChiefOS items

Likely future destinations:
- content ideas
- calendar review queue
- knowledgebase notes
- project-specific action lists

Keep workflow classification separate from destination routing. `/shutdown` should first classify items, then a later step can decide whether each item belongs in Backlog or a more specific database.
